# basic-deep-learning

Simple module for creating deep learning tools, with its own linear algebra and matrices utilities.

This library provides essential deep learning components "built from scratch" with minimal external dependencies. It's designed for educational purposes to help understand the fundamentals of deep learning without relying on complex frameworks.

The library contains:

**Matrix**: a matrix class with all the necessary operations.

**ActivationFunctionsRegistry**: a class containing the most used activation functions.

**MultiLayerPerceptron**: the main class that encapsulates a neural network.

## Installation

The package is available using pip. On your terminal, run

```bash
pip install basic-deep-learning
```

## Dependencies

matplotlib>=3.5.0 (only for visualization).
